<h1>Eartugul Gazi</h1>
<img src="https://i.redd.it/5q96h40t8ve61.jpg">
<p>Ertuğrul or Ertuğrul Gazi (Ottoman Turkish: ارطغرل‎, romanized: Erṭoġrıl; Turkmen: Ärtogrul Gazy; died c. 1280)[7] was the father of Osman I.[8] Little is known about Ertuğrul's life. According to Ottoman tradition, he was the son of Suleyman Shah, the leader of the Kayı tribe (a claim which has come under criticism from many historians)[nb 1] of the Oghuz Turks, who fled from western Central Asia to Anatolia to escape the Mongol conquests, but he may instead have been the son of Gündüz Alp.[5][10] According to this legend, after the death of his father, Ertuğrul and his followers entered the service of the Sultanate of Rum, for which he was rewarded with dominion over the town of Söğüt on the frontier with the Byzantine Empire.[7] <b>This set off the chain of events that would ultimately lead to the founding of the Ottoman Empire.</b></p>
<h1>Halima Sultan</h1>

<p><b>Halime Hatun (Ottoman Turkish: حلیمه خاتون‎) was, according to some Ottoman folklore, the wife of Ertuğrul (13th century) and possibly the mother of Osman I.</b>Her origins are unknown; she is variously referred to as "Hayme Ana" and "Khaimah" in later legends,[2] and is not mentioned at all in any historical Ottoman texts. Hayme Ana is also a traditional name of Ertuğrul's mother.[3]

    Some recent[when?] legends described her as the mother of Osman I; however, historian Heath W. Lowry, among other Ottoman scholars, states that Osman I's mother is unknown.[4] The burial place of Halime Hatun, which was added in the late 19th century by Sultan Abdul Hamid II, is located in the garden of the Ertuğrul Gazi's grave in Söğüt, present-day Turkey.[5] According to historian Cemal Kafadar, the 19th century "recovery" and "rebuilding" of this tomb by the Sultan, with the name added later, was politically motivated.[5]<b> Additionally, according to author Turgut Güler, "Hayme Ana", buried in Domanic, was most likely the wife of Ertuğrul.[2]</b></p>
<h1>Gunduz Bey</h1>

<p>Gündüz Alp was the likely father of Ertuğrul (13th century) and grandfather of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Dynasty.[1][2][3] According to some sources, the name of one of the sons of Ertuğrul was also Gündüz Alp,[4][5] and thus the brother of Osman I.[1][6][7] <b>Ottoman histories, written around the 15th century, differ in details about Osman I's ancestry.</b></p>
<h1>Savci Bey</h1>

<p>Saru Batu Savcı Bey or Saru-Yatı Savcı Beg (died 1287)[2] was the older brother of Osman I, the founder of the Ottoman Empire.[2]<b> He is known to be the most 'mysterious' of Ertuğrul's children.[3]</b></p>
<h1> Osman Gazi </h1>

<p> Osman I or Osman Ghazi (Ottoman Turkish: عثمان غازى‎, romanized: ʿOsmān Ġāzī; Turkish: I. Osman or Osman Gazi; died 1323/4),[1][3] sometimes transliterated archaically as Othman, was the leader of the Ottoman Turks and the founder of the Ottoman dynasty. The dynasty bearing his name later established and ruled the Ottoman Empire (first known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate). This state, while only a small Turkmen[6] principality during Osman's lifetime, transformed into a world empire in the centuries after his death.[7] It existed until shortly after the end of World War I.

    Owing to the scarcity of historical sources dating from his lifetime, very little factual information about Osman has survived. Not a single written source survives from Osman's reign.[8] The Ottomans did not record the history of Osman's life until the fifteenth century, more than a hundred years after his death.[9] Because of this, historians find it very challenging to differentiate between fact and myth in the many stories told about him.[10] One historian has even gone so far as to declare it impossible, describing the period of Osman's life as a "black hole".[11]
    
    According to later Ottoman tradition, Osman's ancestors were descendants of the Kayı tribe of Oghuz Turks.[12] However, many scholars of the early Ottomans regard it as a later fabrication meant to shore up dynastic legitimacy.[12]
    
    <b>The Ottoman principality was one of many Anatolian beyliks that emerged in the second half of the thirteenth century. Situated in the region of Bithynia
         in the north of Asia Minor, Osman's principality found itself particularly well placed to launch attacks on the vulnerable Byzantine Empire, which his descendants would eventually go on to conquer. </b></p>
