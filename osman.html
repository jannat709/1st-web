<p> Osman I or Osman Ghazi (Ottoman Turkish: عثمان غازى‎, romanized: ʿOsmān Ġāzī; Turkish: I. Osman or Osman Gazi; died 1323/4),[1][3] sometimes transliterated archaically as Othman, was the leader of the Ottoman Turks and the founder of the Ottoman dynasty. The dynasty bearing his name later established and ruled the Ottoman Empire (first known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate). This state, while only a small Turkmen[6] principality during Osman's lifetime, transformed into a world empire in the centuries after his death.[7] It existed until shortly after the end of World War I.

    Owing to the scarcity of historical sources dating from his lifetime, very little factual information about Osman has survived. Not a single written source survives from Osman's reign.[8] The Ottomans did not record the history of Osman's life until the fifteenth century, more than a hundred years after his death.[9] Because of this, historians find it very challenging to differentiate between fact and myth in the many stories told about him.[10] One historian has even gone so far as to declare it impossible, describing the period of Osman's life as a "black hole".[11]
    
    According to later Ottoman tradition, Osman's ancestors were descendants of the Kayı tribe of Oghuz Turks.[12] However, many scholars of the early Ottomans regard it as a later fabrication meant to shore up dynastic legitimacy.[12]
    
    <b>The Ottoman principality was one of many Anatolian beyliks that emerged in the second half of the thirteenth century. Situated in the region of Bithynia in the north of Asia Minor, Osman's principality found itself particularly well placed to launch attacks on the vulnerable Byzantine Empire, which his descendants would eventually go on to conquer. </b></p>
<h1> Rabia Bala Hatun </h1>
<img src="https://bolnews.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Bala-Hatun.jpg"></img>
<p>Râbi'a Bâlâ Hâtun (Ottoman Turkish: رابعه بالا خاتون‎; died January 1324[citation needed] birth name Rabia) was the second wife of Ottoman Sultan Osman I.[2][3] She was the daughter of the famous Sheikh Edebali and the mother of Alaeddin Pasha of the Ottoman Empire.<b> Her identity is frequently confused with the mother of Orhan Bey, Malhun Hatun.</b>Edebali's daughter is called by different names in the sources, Rabia and Bala, suggesting that these may have been the names of other wives. Sheikh Edebali's daughter is referred to as "Rabia" in the history of Uric, and as "Malhun" in those of Aşıkpaşazade and Neşri. The latter tradition has proved dominant, and Orhan's mother Malhun Hatun, the daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey, is commonly thought to be Sheikh Edebali's daughter. The 1324 investiture deed for a dervish monastery built by Sultan Orhan suggests that his mother was not, as popular historical tradition holds, the daughter of Edebali, but Malhun Hatun, the daughter of one "Umar Bey or Ömer Bey". The title "Bey", used by the princely dynasties of Anatolia, suggests that Malhun Hatun's father was a person of certain status and authority.[citation needed]
   <b> The marriage of Osman and Rabia Bala Hatun occurred in 1289. From the central government records regarding the property she received at the time of her marriage; the village of Kozağaç in the district of Bilecik, where the dervish hospice of her father was located. Edebali was an influential religious leader in the Ottoman territories.[citation needed]</b></p>
<h1>Malhun Hatun</h1>
<img src="https://d3h48bfc4uelnv.cloudfront.net/public-imgs/147f403e-7610-4244-bddf-0ffea3e41b09.jpg">
<p>Malhun Hatun (also called Mal Hatun; d. November 1326)[1][2] was the first wife of Osman I,[3][4][5] the leader of the Ottoman Turks and the founder of the dynasty that established and ruled the Ottoman Empire. She was the mother of Sultan Orhan, Pazarlı Bey, Fatma Hatun, Hamid Bey, Çoban Bey, Melik Bey and Savcı Bey[6]  It has been recognised by many historians that she was the daughter of the Anatolian Turkish Bey, Ömer Bey,[14] although there had been many speculations that she was the daughter of Sheikh Edebali. Other sources say that she was the daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey, Seljuk Vizier of Anatolia.[15]

    The 1324 endowment deed for a Dervish Monastery built by Sultan Orhan suggests that his mother was not, as popular historical tradition maintains, Edebali's daughter but rather Mal Hatun, the daughter of one "Umar Bey or Ömer Bey". The title "Bey", used by the princely dynasties of Anatolia, suggests that Mal Hatun's father was a person of some status and authority. One possibility is that he was the eponymous ruler of an "Amouri" (Umeri) Principality, which was located northeast of the emerging Ottoman State and disappeared in the late 13th or the early 14th century. The Amouri are described by the Byzantine historian George Pachymeres, who says that a son of Umar fought with Osman in one of his first raids against local Byzantine lords (the victory of Baphaion). The Ottomans, according to Pachymeres, went on to assume the role played by Amouri until their demise as the principal aggressor against the Byzantines in the northwest Anatolia. If Pachymeres's report is correct, the timing and the political context are appropriate for a marriage between Osman and 'Umar Bey's daughter.[16]
    
    <b>Mal Hatun has a central role in the legendary Osman's Dream, depicting Osman's great love for her and the long struggle he had to undergo before being able to gain her hand. The account is, however, considered to have been composed centuries later, reflecting later generations' perception of her rather than the historical reality. She died in 1326</b></p>
<h1>Orhan Gazi</h1>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orhan"> Orhan1 </a>
<p> Orhan Ghazi (Ottoman Turkish: اورخان غازی‎; Turkish: Orhan Gazi, also spelled Orkhan, c. 1281 – March 1362) was the second bey of the Ottoman Beylik from 1323/4 to 1362. He was born in Söğüt,<b> as the son of Osman.</b>
    In the early stages of his reign, Orhan focused his energies on conquering most of northwestern Anatolia. The majority of these areas were under Byzantine rule and he won his first battle at Pelekanon against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Orhan also occupied the lands of the Karasids of Balıkesir and the Ahis of Ankara.
    
    A series of civil wars surrounding the ascension of the nine-year-old Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos greatly benefited Orhan.[citation needed] In the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, the regent John VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors against the rival forces of the empress dowager, allowing them to loot Thrace. In the Byzantine civil war of 1352–1357, Kantakouzenos used Ottoman forces against John V, granting them the use of a European fortress at Çimpe around 1352.[2][3] A major earthquake devastated Gallipoli (modern Gelibolu) two years later, after which Orhan's son, Süleyman Pasha, occupied the town, giving the Ottomans a strong bridgehead into mainland Europe.
    
    <b>According to Muslim scholar Ibn Battuta, Orhan was "the greatest of the Turkmen kings and the richest in wealth, lands, and military forces".[4]</b></p>
    <h1>Alaeddin Pasha</h1>
    <img src="https://alchetron.com/cdn/alaeddin-pasha-vizier-a91f84ee-ec3d-46bd-a619-da72581f8b4-resize-750.jpeg">
    <p>Alaeddin Bey, or Alaeddin Pasha (Alâeddin Paşa; Söğüt, 1290/1292 – Bursa, 1331), was the brother of Orhan I, who succeeded their father, Osman I Ghazi, in the leadership of the Ottoman Empire. His mother was a Turkish woman named Rabia Bala Hatun. It is not certain whether Alaeddin or Orhan was the elder son. Some historians claim that Alaeddin was Osman's second son, but others argue that there is a good chance that he was the oldest. Nevertheless, Orhan ruled the country and became the first Ottoman ruler to take the title of Sultan. According to tradition and Ottoman historiography as presented by historian Idris Bitlisi, Alaeddin was more passive than his energetic, warrior brother, and thus stayed at home instead of fighting to expand the newly forming Ottoman Empire. He received training in the management of state affairs. <b>There is a good chance that Orhan was selected to inherit leadership of the Empire because of his skills as a warrior.</b></p>
